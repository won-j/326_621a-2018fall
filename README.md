## Course Overview

### Assessment

The course will be graded based on the following components:

- **Attendence** (10%): Includes both the lecture and the lab sessions.
- **Assignments** (90%): You will be assigned four computational assignments regularly throughout class. 
    * All the homework assignments *must* be submitted to github.

### Late policy

- Late homework submission will be deducted from its original score 50% per day.
